But finding a project to volunteer is not so easy. Mainly because different hosts publish their projects on their own websites and facebook pages and they are scattered everywhere. VolunteerME is a common place to list down all the volunteering opportunities in Sri Lanka so that anyone can easily find and work in projects. 

### How it works

Volunteer event hosts can submit their events into VolunteerME by the submission page and upon successfull submission the host will recieve a text message. The volunteers can view the hosted events from the listings page and they can filter the nearby events by location.


## Features

- Submit volunteering oppotunities.
- Search and filter oppotunities
- Receive submission confirmations using Twilio [Programmable SMS](<[https://www.twilio.com/sms](https://www.twilio.com/sms)>) .


# Set up


### Requirements

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)
- A Firebase account - [sign up](https://console.firebase.google.com/)


### Local development

After the above requirements have been met: 
<br><br>

<b>1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it</b>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suvink/volunteer-me.git
cd volunteer-me
```
<br>

<b>2. Install dependencies</b>

```bash
npm install
```
<br>

<b>3. Setup Firebase Project</b>

Goto your <a href="">Firebase Console </a>and create a new project in Firebase Console. Then register a new web app.
Copy the **config data** from the config file which will look like this.
```
apiKey: "firebase-api-key",
authDomain: "firebase-auth-domain",
databaseURL: "firebase-db-url",
projectId: "firebase-project-id",
storageBucket: "firebase-storage-bucket",
messagingSenderId: "firebase-messaging-id",
appId: "firebase-app-id"
```
<br>

<b>4. Setup Firebase Configuration</b>

Rename the `sample.env.txt` file into `.env` and add your previously copied Firebase configuration details there. (Replace the `######` marks with relevant details.)
<br>
**Note: Leave the `VUE_APP_BACKENDURL` as it is for now. It will be configured later.**
<br>
<br>

<b>5. Setup Firebase Realtime Database</b>

Goto `Database` section in your Firebase Console and create a **Realtime Database**. Import `database.json` file in the `src` folder into Firebase Database. It will create dummy data for you to test.
<br>
<br>

<b>6. Setup the backend.</b>
<br>
You can find the source code and setup guide for the backend <a href="https://github.com/Suvink/volunteerme-functions">here</a>
